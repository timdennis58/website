# Sample Website

This is a sample website made as part of [*Learn enough Git to be dangerous*](https://learnenough.com/git-tutorial),
possibly a decent git tutorial.

After finishing the tutorial *Learn Enough Git to be dangerous*, you'll know enough Git to be *dangerous* This means you'll be able to use Git to track changes in your projects, back up data, share your work with others, and collaborate with programmers and other users around the world.
